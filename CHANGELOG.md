### Added
- Blind adversarial review workflow: plans and test specs get checked by reviewers that cannot read the implementation, so tests stay grounded in behavior instead of getting patched to pass.
- Enforced lanes: only the approving reviewer can write approved specs or tests, blocking orchestrators from weakening or bypassing tests after the fact.
